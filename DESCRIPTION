Title: Do Purrr in Parallel
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Moosa",
           family = "Rezwani",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
           email = "moosa.rezwani@gmail.com")
Description: Run purrr's mapping functions in parallel (i.e., incorporate
    multiple CPU cores instead of the default, one). The package parapurrr
    does that by connecting purrr to foreach package and its adaptors.
    Users are only required to add a prefix "pa_" before their desired
    purrr functions (e.g. pa_map instead of map). All map family functions
    and all foreach adaptors on CRAN are supported.
