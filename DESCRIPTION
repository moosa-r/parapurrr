Description: This package Connects Purrr and Foreach packages. The only thing
    you need to do is to add a "pa_" suffix before your purrr functions. That's
    it! The purrr's mapping functins will be handled to Foreeach and you can
    use every available CPU cores in your computer. Of course, there are other
    extra arguments that will give you more control, but they are optional.
