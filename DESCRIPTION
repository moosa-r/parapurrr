Description: This package Connects Purrr and Foreach
    packages. The only thing you need to do is to add a "pa_" suffix
    before your purrr functions. That's it! The purrr's mapping functins
    will be handled to Foreeach and you can use every available CPU cores
    in your computer. Of course, there are other extra arguments that will
    give you more control, but they are optional.
