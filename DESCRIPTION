Description: parapurrr is a package to run purrr's mapping functions in
    parallel (i.e., incorporating multiple CPU cores instead of the
    default, one); It simply does it by connecting purrr with foreach
    package and its adaptors. Users are only required to add a prefix
    "pa_" before their desired purrr functions (e.g. pa_map instead of
    map). That's it! You do not need to worry about anything else, the
    rest will be handled internally for you.
